            Girls who learn coding are ahead of the curve; after all, the world of tech is shaping the times we live in and the road ahead. In today’s world, there’s the literate and then there’s the computer-literate; of the two, it’s the latter group that is more poised for success. From airplanes and cars to video games, space exploration and medicine, programming is now being used in every profession. Publishing this piece too needed coding.  
            Brian Contos, whose daughter is a student at YoungWonks, emphasises that learning coding is a life skill today. “Like reading, writing and arithmetic, all kids should learn to code. My daughter doesn’t have to grow up to be a software engineer, but I think it’s important for her and all young people to know how to code and understand computers beyond the basics.” 
            Women learning coding are better placed to keep pace with men in the workplace. Given that coding is among the fastest growing fields today, women who code can be part of a bigger job market and receive a higher premium for their work than in other fields. According to a Catalyst report, women in STEM jobs in the United States earned 35 percent more than women in non-STEM jobs and 40 percent more than men in non-STEM jobs in the year 2016. 
            Girls who know coding can work at some of the biggest companies in the world, be it NASA or Facebook. You could do so by becoming a white-collar hacker, where you hack to identify security gaps in company’s website. So coding is ideal for girls who think big. 
            Coding can open up a world of possibilities for you. It equips you to create your own website or app and build a robot or even a video game. If that doesn’t make you feel powerful, we don’t know what will! 
            Knowing coding helps with critical thinking and logical reasoning. “Coding encourages you to deal with large problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable ones. It relies on maths and logic to come up with innovative solutions to otherwise complex problems,” says Suchin Ravi, lead instructor at YoungWonks. 
            The list won’t be complete without this reason: coding is fun. Imagine creating a game where you are teaming up with Wonder Woman and taking on Ares and Doctor Poison!
